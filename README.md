The _DAI Stablecoin System_ incentivizes external agents, called _keepers_,
to automate certain operations around the Ethereum blockchain.

`arbitrage-keeper` performs arbitrage on OasisDEX, `join`, `exit`, `boom` and `bust`.

Keeper constantly looks for profitable enough arbitrage opportunities
and executes them the moment they become available. It can make profit on:
- taking orders on OasisDEX (on SAI/SKR, SAI/W-ETH and SKR/W-ETH pairs),
- calling `join` and `exit` to exchange between W-ETH and SKR,
- calling `boom` and `bust` to exchange between SAI and SKR.

Opportunities discovered by the keeper are sequences of token exchanges
executed using methods listed above. An opportunity can consist of two
or three steps, technically it could be more but practically it will never
be more than three.

Steps can be executed sequentially (each one as a separate Ethereum
transaction, checking if one has been successful before executing the next
one) or in one ago. The latter method requires a `TxManager` contract deployed,
its address has to be passed as the `--tx-manager` argument. Also the `TxManager`
contract has to be owned by the account the keeper operates from.

You can find the source code of the `TxManager` here:
<https://github.com/makerdao/tx-manager>.

The base token is the token all arbitrage opportunities will start with.
Some amount of this token will be exchanged to some other token(s) and then exchanged
back to the base token, aiming to end up with more of it than we started with.
It implies that some amount of this token has to be provided to the keeper.
The higher the amount, the more profitable each arbitrage may be. Maximum
engagement in terms of base token can be set using the `--max-engagement` argument.

It is also beneficial to provide very small amounts of other tokens to the
keeper as well, mostly because of the rounding issues which may occur on
subsequent arbitrage steps. Currently the keeper operates on SAI, SKR and W-ETH.
It means that if we choose SAI as the base token, we should also give it some tiny
amounts of SKR and W-ETH. It may happen that due to rounding issues these amounts
will increase or decrease over time. Usually it is no more than 1 Wei increase
or decrease per one arbitrage opportunity.

The keeper is aware of gas costs and takes a rough estimate of these costs while
calculating arbitrage profitability. Having said that, this feature still requires
some improvement (see <https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrage-keeper/issues/1>).

## Installation

This project uses *Python 3.6.2*.

In order to clone the project and install required third-party packages please execute:
```
git clone https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrage-keeper.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Known macOS issues

In order for the Python requirements to install correctly on _macOS_, please install
`openssl`, `libtool` and `pkg-config` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```
brew install openssl libtool pkg-config
```

and set the `LDFLAGS` environment variable before you run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`:
```
export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib" CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include" 
```
